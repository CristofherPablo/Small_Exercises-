          It is a survivor of the Ice Age, originating from the Upper
          Pleistocene, about 300,000 years ago. DNA sequencing and genetic
          studies reaffirm that the gray wolf is the ancestor of the domestic
          dog.

          The weight and size of wolves vary greatly throughout the world,
          tending to increase proportionally with latitude, as predicted by the
          theory of Christian Bergmann. Generally, the height, measured from the
          shoulders, ranges from 60 to 95 centimeters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weight varies geographically. On average, European wolves weigh
          38.5 kg; North American wolves weigh 36 kg; Indian and Arabian wolves
          weigh 25 kg. Although rare, wolves weighing more than 77 kg have been
          found in Alaska, Canada, and the former Soviet Union.

            There is something in the howl of the wolf that takes a man out of
            the here and now and transports him to a realm in the mind.

            Wolves are social animals that live in packs, which are usually
            composed of a mated pair and their offspring. They are known for
            their distinctive howling, which is used to communicate with other
            members of the pack over long distances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wolves are carnivorous and primarily hunt large prey such as deer,
            elk, and moose, although they will also eat smaller mammals such as
            rodents and rabbits.
